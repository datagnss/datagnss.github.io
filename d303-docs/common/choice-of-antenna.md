## Choose GNSS antenna type

<br>

For some GIS applications or general data collection, we recommend you choose helix antenna.This kind of field application is less demanding on
precision to a few centimeters.

<br>

It is difficult to align helix antenna's phase center to the ground point,so there is also no so-called instrument height.

<br>

The unstable grip of the hand may cause an error of about 10-20cm.

**Helix antenna is with much more multi-path effect which will greatly reduce the quality of the raw data, thus affecting the accuracy of rtk.**

<br>
<br>
For land survey applications or some high precision cm-level applications, we recommend you choose
survey-grade patch antenna.

<br>

Also patch antenna have a big ground plane to reduce multi-path effect.

**The LNA gain of the antenna is an important technical parameter.**
**D303 and our EVK need minimum LNA gain is 40dB**
