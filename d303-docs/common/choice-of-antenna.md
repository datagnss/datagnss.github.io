## choose GNSS antenna type

<br>
For some GIS applications or general data collection, we recommend you choose helix antenna.

Helix antenna have no determined phase center,so there is also no so-called instrument height.

For land survey applications or some high precision cm-level applications, we recommend you choose
survey-grade patch antenna.

<br>
Also patch antenna have a big ground plane to reduce multi-path effect.
