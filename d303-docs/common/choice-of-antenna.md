## Choose GNSS antenna type

<br>

For some GIS applications or general data collection, we recommend you choose helix antenna.This kind of field application is less demanding on
precision to a few centimeters.

<br>

It is difficult to align helix antenna's phase center to the ground point,so there is also no so-called instrument height.

<br>

The unstable grip of the hand may cause an error of about 10-20cm.

For land survey applications or some high precision cm-level applications, we recommend you choose
survey-grade patch antenna.

<br>

Also patch antenna have a big ground plane to reduce multi-path effect.
