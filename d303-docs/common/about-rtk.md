## About RTK

### What is RTK?
    Real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning is a satellite navigation technique used to enhance 
	the precision of position data derived from satellite-based positioning systems (global navigation
	satellite systems, GNSS) such as GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou. It uses measurements of the phase
	of the signal's carrier wave in addition to the information content of the signal and relies on a single
	reference station or interpolated virtual station to provide real-time corrections, providing up to 
	centimetre-level accuracy.[1] With reference to GPS in particular, the system is commonly referred to as 
	carrier-phase enhancement, or CPGPS.[2] It has applications in land survey, hydrographic survey, and in 
	unmanned aerial vehicle navigation.
