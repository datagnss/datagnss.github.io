> **Note**: The following content was completed with the assistance of Claude AI. It may contain errors; please use with caution.

QZSS MADOCA-PPP achieved full operational status in April 2024, delivering centimeter-level positioning accuracy across Asia-Oceania through satellite-based precise point positioning corrections. The service now supports both standard PPP and enhanced PPP-AR (ambiguity resolution) capabilities, with recent expansion including ionospheric corrections via new QZS-6 satellite and internet distribution for global access.

MADOCA-PPP represents a major advancement in regional satellite augmentation services, providing free precise positioning that competes with commercial services while offering unique regional optimizations. The system leverages Japan's QZSS constellation to deliver corrections via L6 signals at 1278.75 MHz, achieving approximately 10cm positioning accuracy with convergence times significantly improved through recent technical enhancements.

## Service architecture and current capabilities

MADOCA-PPP operates through an integrated ground-space system combining global monitoring networks with advanced correction algorithms. The **MIRAI network** collects real-time observations from over 30 worldwide monitoring stations, including IGS network cooperation, while JAXA's advanced MADOCA algorithms generate orbit and clock corrections with unprecedented precision.

The service currently augments **65+ satellites** across multiple constellations: approximately 25 GPS, 17 GLONASS, 20 Galileo, and 3 QZSS satellites. **Multi-GNSS support** encompasses GPS L1C/A through L5, QZSS L1C/A through L5, GLONASS G1/G2, and Galileo E1/E5a signals, with BeiDou support under development.

**Performance specifications** meet rigorous standards with horizontal accuracy ≤30cm (95%) and vertical accuracy ≤50cm (95%), though real-world performance consistently achieves ~10cm positioning accuracy. The system maintains **>99% service availability** across the Asia-Oceania region where at least one QZS satellite is visible above 10° elevation with 20+ augmented satellites accessible.

Distribution occurs through dual pathways: **satellite-based L6E signals** provide regional coverage optimized for Asia-Oceania, while **internet distribution** launched in July 2024 enables global research and development access through NTRIP streaming and FTP archives.

## PPP versus PPP-AR technical implementation differences

### Standard PPP (Float Solution) Implementation

**Core algorithm approach:**
Standard PPP achieves centimeter-level accuracy using satellite orbit and clock corrections while treating carrier phase ambiguities as **float parameters** in the estimation process. The approach requires 20-30 minute convergence periods as the filter gradually resolves atmospheric delays and ambiguity values through continuous observations.

**Required correction data from L6E:**
- **ST2 orbit corrections**: 3D satellite position corrections  
- **ST3 clock corrections**: High-precision satellite clock offsets
- **ST4 code bias corrections**: Differential code biases for pseudorange measurements
- **ST5 phase bias corrections**: *Optional* - not utilized in float solutions

**Processing characteristics:**
- **Ambiguity handling**: Float values estimated as nuisance parameters
- **Convergence behavior**: Gradual improvement over 20-30 minutes
- **Accuracy after convergence**: 3-10cm horizontal, 5-15cm vertical (95th percentile)
- **Computational load**: Moderate - standard Kalman filtering
- **Reliability**: Consistent performance, lower risk of incorrect solutions

### Enhanced PPP-AR (Integer Ambiguity Resolution) Implementation

**Core algorithm approach:**
PPP-AR significantly enhances performance by resolving carrier phase ambiguities to **integer values** through advanced mathematical techniques. This process requires additional **Fractional Cycle Bias (FCB)** corrections and sophisticated ambiguity resolution algorithms, but delivers superior accuracy and faster convergence.

**Essential correction data from L6E:**
- **ST2 orbit corrections**: High-precision satellite orbits (accuracy requirement: <2.7cm RMS)
- **ST3 clock corrections**: Sub-nanosecond satellite clock corrections  
- **ST4 code bias corrections**: Multi-frequency differential code biases
- **ST5 phase bias corrections**: **MANDATORY** - Wide-lane and narrow-lane FCB values for integer recovery

**Advanced processing workflow:**
```
PPP-AR Processing Pipeline:
1. Initialize with standard PPP float solution
2. Apply wide-lane FCB corrections from ST5
3. Resolve wide-lane ambiguities using Melbourne-Wübbena combination
4. Apply narrow-lane FCB corrections from ST5  
5. Resolve narrow-lane ambiguities using LAMBDA algorithm
6. Validate integer solutions through ratio testing
7. Fix ambiguities and continue with constrained solution
```

**Performance characteristics:**
- **Convergence improvement**: 21-89% faster than float PPP (typical: 10-15 minutes)
- **Accuracy enhancement**: 13-32% better positioning accuracy
- **Final precision**: 2-8cm horizontal, 3-12cm vertical (95th percentile)
- **Computational complexity**: High - requires integer search algorithms
- **Success rate**: >95% under nominal conditions, sensitive to observation quality

### Critical technical requirements for PPP-AR success

**Satellite orbit quality threshold:**
PPP-AR demands exceptional orbit accuracy because integer ambiguity resolution is highly sensitive to systematic errors. **Orbit corrections must achieve <2.7cm RMS accuracy** to enable reliable integer resolution - a requirement that MADOCA consistently meets with 2.8cm median GPS orbit accuracy.

**Phase bias correction processing:**
The **ST5 phase bias corrections** represent the most critical component for PPP-AR success:
- **Wide-lane FCB**: Enables initial ambiguity resolution using geometry-free combinations
- **Narrow-lane FCB**: Enables high-precision ambiguity resolution for final positioning
- **Consistency requirements**: FCB values must be consistent across all processed satellites
- **Update frequency**: Typically updated every 24 seconds via L6E messages

**Multi-constellation considerations:**
PPP-AR performance scales significantly with the number of available satellites:
- **Minimum requirement**: 6-8 satellites for basic functionality
- **Optimal performance**: 15+ satellites from multiple constellations
- **QZSS advantage**: High elevation angles over Asia-Oceania improve geometric strength
- **Galileo benefits**: Independent signal structure enhances solution robustness

### Ionospheric correction integration effects

**Without L6D ionospheric corrections (standard approach):**
- **Dual-frequency elimination**: Uses L1/L2 or L1/L5 combinations to eliminate first-order ionospheric delays
- **Residual errors**: Second and higher-order ionospheric effects remain
- **Convergence time**: Standard 20-30 minutes for float PPP, 10-15 minutes for PPP-AR
- **Performance variability**: Significantly affected by ionospheric activity levels

**With L6D ionospheric corrections (enhanced approach):**
- **Direct correction**: STEC grid corrections applied before dual-frequency processing
- **Residual minimization**: Eliminates most ionospheric delay components
- **Convergence acceleration**: Reduces to 6-9 minutes average for PPP-AR
- **Single-frequency capability**: Enables high-precision positioning with L1-only receivers
- **Regional optimization**: Performance varies by L6D coverage area (optimal in Japan/Australia)

**Implementation recommendations:**
Users implementing MADOCA PPP-AR should prioritize obtaining reliable ST5 phase bias corrections while treating L6D ionospheric corrections as valuable performance enhancers. The system architecture should support graceful degradation from PPP-AR to standard PPP when correction data becomes unavailable, ensuring continuous operation under all conditions.

## Ionospheric correction data and satellite-specific broadcasts

**QZS-6 satellite (PRN 200)** launched February 2025 and began operational services July 18, 2025, transmitting **regional ionospheric corrections via L6D signals**. Coverage areas include Australia, Southeast Asia, and Indonesian regions through specifically defined rectangular correction planes around Adelaide, Perth, Philippine Islands, and Indonesian territories.

**QZS-7 satellite (PRN 201)** scheduled for 2025 launch will provide complementary ionospheric corrections covering Japan, East Asia, and Australian east coast regions. The satellite will broadcast corrections for Japan's main islands through 8 rectangular planes spanning Hokkaido to Kyushu, plus circular coverage for Ogasawara Islands, addressing areas like Tokyo (36.11°N, 140.09°E) and Hiroshima (34.44°N, 132.41°E).

**Ionospheric correction implementation** uses Compact State Space Representation (CSSR) format with grid-based models employing bi-linear interpolation. The system provides **Slant Total Electron Content (STEC) corrections** updated every 30-60 seconds, enabling single-frequency high-accuracy positioning and reducing multi-frequency PPP convergence from traditional 20-30 minutes to significantly shorter periods.

**Technical transmission characteristics** utilize L6D signals distinct from standard L6E corrections, allowing simultaneous broadcast of global PPP corrections (L6E) and regional ionospheric enhancements (L6D). This dual-signal approach provides backward compatibility while enabling advanced users to leverage regional improvements.
