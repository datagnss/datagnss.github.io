## Overview

Pocket SDR FE 4CH is an open-source GNSS SDR RF frontend device for Pocket SDR.
The device consists of 4 CH Maxim MAX2771 GNSS RF front-end ICs (LNA, mixer, filter, ADC, frequency synthesizer) and a Cypress EZ-USB FX3 USB 3.0 controller to connect to host PCs.
All the RF CHs are able to be configured for GNSS L1 band (1525 - 1610 MHz), or GNSS L2/L5/L6 band (1160 - 1290 MHz).
The frequency of the reference oscillator (TCXO) is 24.000 MHz, and the ADC sampling rate can be configured up to 48 Msps.
