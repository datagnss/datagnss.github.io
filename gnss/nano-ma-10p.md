# MA-10P PPP GNSS Receiver

## Overview
The MA-10P PPP GNSS Receiver is designed to support QZSS MADOCA PPP positioning services.

MA-10P fully supports QZSS MADOCA PPP positioning, enabling both PPP and PPP-AR modes.

For more details on QZSS MADOCA PPP services, please refer to [Multi-GNSS Advanced Orbit and Clock Augmentation - Precise Point Positioning (MADOCA-PPP)](https://qzss.go.jp/en/overview/services/sv13_madoca.html).

The MA-10P can independently receive L6E service data, decode it, and achieve PPP and PPP-AR positioning.

MA-10P is also seamlessly compatible with the Raspberry Pi Zero, allowing you to run your own PPP algorithms and develop additional applications on the Pi Zero.
