## Overview

![NANO RTK Receiver](../../../images/gnss/NANO-RTK-with-case-ant-bg-760x.png)

NANO RTK Receiver is the latest high-precision RTK receiver based on Allystar's latest generation GNSS SoC.
It can simultaneously support tracking all visible navigation satellites, including GPS, QZSS, BDS, GALILEO, GLONASS, and IRNSS.

It support RTK base and rover options.

You could choose Helix antenna and Survey antenna for your applications.

It has two interface: USB serial port and 6P connenctor.
It support Bluetooth (BLE and Bluetooth Classic SPP).

Note: only SKU: NANO-BT-00 support bluetooth.

Compaible with:

By default, NANO series supports three types of external connections: Bluetooth, UART, and USB connection.
For SKU: NANO-BT-00 Receiver, support the following connection:

| Connection | Remark | 
| --- | --- |
| USB C | Input: RTCM, Binary, Command <br> Output: Binary, RTCM, NMEA |
| Bluetooth | Input: RTCM, Binary, Command <br> Output: Binary, RTCM, NMEA |
| 6P UART | Input: - <br> Output: RTCM, NMEA |

Other NANO series (the following sku) do not support Bluetooth connection, but the 6P UART can fully support data input and output.

NANO-DG-xx, NANO-HRTK-00

| Connection | Remark | 
| --- | --- |
| USB C | Input: RTCM, Binary, Command <br> Output: Binary, RTCM, NMEA |
Output: Binary, RTCM, NMEA
| Bluetooth | - |
| 6P UART | Input: RTCM, Binary, Command <br> Output: Binary, RTCM, NMEA |

## Application

### Work with other devices

Telemetry radio for Base station
Connect telemetry radio device with RTK Receiver via 6P connector.

### Ardupilot setup

NANO RTK Receiver support to use on autopilot.<br>
For example,NANO is connected to the autopilot's SERIAL4 port, it should work with :

[SERIAL4_PROTOCOL](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/AP_Periph-Parameters.html#serial4-protocol-serial4-protocol-selection) = 5

[GPS1_TYPE](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/parameters.html#gps1-type-gps-type) = 5
